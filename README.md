# CS 418: Interactive Computer Graphics â€“ Fall 2024

This repository contains my projects and code submissions for the **CS 418: Interactive Computer Graphics** course offered at UIUC. The course focuses on the development and implementation of interactive 3D computer graphics using WebGL2 and various techniques in rendering, motion simulation, and particle effects.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

**Instructor**: Luther Tychonievich  
**Course Page**: [CS 418 - Interactive Computer Graphics](https://cs418.cs.illinois.edu)

This course covers the following key topics:

- 3D computer graphics (rasterization, ray tracing)
- Using WebGL2 to create interactive 3D graphics
- Geometry generation, camera movement, and texture mapping
- Particle effects and basic graphical motion simulation

The course also explores topics such as shadow maps, deferred shading, animation, fractals, and more.

## ðŸ’» Project Overview

This repository includes my solutions and implementations for various **Machine Problems (MPs)** as part of the CS 418 course. These projects demonstrate my understanding of key concepts in interactive graphics, including the following:

- **MP1**: Basic 3D Rendering with WebGL2
- **MP2**: Raytracing Techniques
- **MP3**: Texture Mapping and Shaders
- **MP4**: Particle Effects and Simulation
- **MP5**: Advanced Rendering Techniques

Each project follows the course guidelines and demonstrates my ability to create interactive computer graphics and implement algorithms relevant to real-time rendering and graphics simulations.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prerequisites

To run the projects locally, youâ€™ll need the following:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- **WebGL2** compatible environment (most modern browsers support this natively)

### Steps to Run the Projects

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cs418-interactive-graphics.git
